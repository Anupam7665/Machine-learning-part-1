    "**Over-fitting**: Over-fitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying pattern. This leads to a model that performs very well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. The consequences of over-fitting are reduced accuracy and poor generalization.\n",

    "Use regularization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization or dropout to add a penalty term to the loss function, which will discourage the model from over-fitting the data.\n",
